# URL Shortener

The goal is to make a URL shortener full-stack application using React for the frontend, and NodeJS for the backend.

## Requirements

* User must be able to put a valid URL into the home page and get back a URL of the shortest possible length.
* User must not be able to submit an empty URL, if the user tries to do so, an error message must be shown.
* User must be redirected to the full URL when entering the short URL (ex: http://myshortener.whatever/a => https://google.com)
* User must be able to view the Top 100 most frequently accessed URLs.
* Inputting an invalid URL should result in displaying an error to the user.
* There must be a README that explains how to set up the application.


## Final notes

It's my first full-stack app so it's a work in progress
